### R.A.P.L. Command Descriptions

- **let**: Defines a non-constant variable, allowing for dynamic data manipulation throughout the program.

- **and**: Performs a logical AND operation between two values. Returns `1` only if both values are `1` (e.g., `1 and 0` results in `0`).

- **or**: Executes a logical OR operation between two values. Returns `1` if at least one of the values is `1` (e.g., `1 or 0` results in `1`).

- **not**: Inverts a boolean value, turning `1` into `0` and vice versa (e.g., `not 1` results in `0`).

- **if**: Evaluates a condition and executes the following block of code if the condition is true.

- **elif**: Specifies an additional condition to check if the preceding `if` condition is false; executes if this condition is true.

- **else**: Provides an alternative block of code to execute when the preceding `if` and `if` conditions are false, requiring no additional arguments.

- **for**: Initiates a loop that iterates a specified number of times. For example, `for i = 0 to 5` runs the block five times.

- **to**: Indicates the end value in a `for` loop, defining the range of iterations.

- **step**: Specifies the increment or decrement value for a loop, controlling how much the loop variable changes with each iteration (e.g., `step 1` or `step -1`).

- **while**: Begins a loop that continues to execute as long as a specified condition remains true.

- **def**: Defines a reusable block of code (a function) that can be called throughout the program.

- **then**: Specifies the block of code to execute following a condition or loop declaration.

- **end**: Marks the conclusion of a code block, loop, or function definition.

- **return**: Exits a function and optionally provides a value back to the caller.

- **continue**: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.

- **break**: Exits the nearest enclosing loop immediately, terminating the iteration process.
